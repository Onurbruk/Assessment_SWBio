SWBio Data Science and Machine Learning Project

In the repository we can find the files for my SWBio assessment. It consists in use machine learning techniques to classify data from a public dataset that possess information about Iris flowers, for this project I created a annotated Python code, that uses the Iris Dataset, and a description of the project in a word file. 

Repository Content

1. BCR_Assessment_classification.py
Consists in the main annotated Python script that create a classification method on the Iris dataset. 

2. Iris.data
This file is the sample that provide measurements of the flowers, this information consists on sepal length and width and also petal length and width, it also contains the species identification.

3.README.md
In this file I have created a overview of this project and instructions to run the annotated code. 

Running the code

1. Requirements
For this code I have used the following packages numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. In order to run the code correctly those packages need to be installed. 

2. Running the code
To run this code its necessary to clone the repository in your machine and the use python to run the annotated code.

3. Data
The repository contains the necessary data for the code, which allows the script to be tested.
